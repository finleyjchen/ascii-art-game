# ascii-art-game
<p> General Idea for this game, to be based off Java (what I know so far, mostly based off Object-Oriented Programming, but am open to learning other languages that would best fit this project.<br>

   ASCII ART PROJECT GAME Finley Chen First Edit: January 30, 2017 - Laid groundworks for Key game ideas and concepts Architecture: Java 1.8? Platform: PC<br>

Type of Game: Turn Based RPG Graphics: ASCII Art | Console like window<br>

Controls: Use arrow keys to select, like Pokemon<br>
            Character Creation: User creates character<br>
            Can draw own signature/person?<br>
            Name<br>
            Class?<br>
            Skill point system?<br>
            Zone System:<br>
        Linear focused, discovering new "locations" with actions to do on each destination<br>
        Shop zones, save zones, farming zones, each zone with unique characters and a wallpaper drawn through ascii Each zone has possible options:<br>
        Fight?<br>
        Shop?<br>
        Talk to people drop down menu<br>
        Shows a list of people currently there, whether they are there or not depends on story line progress or random?<br>
        Fighting system:<br>
      Every fight has possibilities of dropped loot, several enemies?<br>
        Every boss area will just be the boss when fighting<br>
        Zone may change background after story events, e.g boss zone destroyed. Turn Based concept: Spd attribute decides who gets to attack first. Health and Mana. Every turn goes through phases, Turn Start -> Event Phase -> Choice -> Event Phase -> End turn Event phases are turn based things that are either start or end of your turn (like gain health per turn) Having a certain multiple of greater SPD can determine quick strikes, second hits, etc. <br>Fighting Menu choices: Attack - Basic Attack that is based off of a certain stat Block - Some sort of block Skill - sword skills, magic skills, relative to class Run - Flee based off of a stat Item - Use items strategically (heals, Stat modifiers maybe?)<br> Possibility to add recruitment for party system<br>
        Skills: Skills can be used during fights, maybe have unique passive skills, and common skills for each character class? Skills can be learned through items or events during the game? e.g Skill teachers? Specific to class TBD<br>
        Each character/save file attributes:<br>
        Current zone<br>
        Experience towards lvl, each lvl skill point maybe?<br>
        Items/Equipment<br>
        Skillpoint allocation<br>
        Party system/quest companions<br>
        Gold<br>
        Current Quests?<br>
        Discovered areas<br>
        Value for level on story line<br>
        Character name/drawing?<br>
        Relationships???<br>
        Class<br>
        Map View<br>
        Can view different places, connected with distance between each. Perhaps distance to be used for poison damage, hunger, taxes?, speed when someone chasing you?<br>
        Example Character attributes: Name - Finley Class - Thief Current Zone - Forest of Fallen Giants B3 Gold - 40050 Current Items - Berry, branch (quest item), potion, mana potion Skills - 5 points in Blade Flurry, 3 points in assassin, 0 points in idk Current Companion: Dog? or maybe additional companion slot for like pets, other for mercenaries you can contract at taverns, or quest-specific companions e.g. escort mission? Quest Completion - 58%, on quest 13 part 40. Parts would be levels of progress, like has spoken to lord +1 in part.<br>
        Quests: Quest examples would be like exploring new areas until you reach boss level Talking to a certain person at an area Returning to an area Finding an item with unique option search<br>
        Enemies: Two types, common and boss Common have only like 20 types, certain ones appear in diferent zones and some have different chances of showing up. Kill 10 Hyenas could be a quest. Bosses have unique pictures, names, and stats. There is a randomization stat threshold unique to level, etc. Enemies have own stats as well as picture, and skill.<br>
        Base line - Fighting system - Turn based Quest system Location/zone system Items/Loot system Skill System Map View System Enemy system<br>
        Possible addons/patches in the future: Extended storylines Side quests Relationships Mouse interaction Secondary partner combat system Party system? Enhanced art system Unique skill system<br>
